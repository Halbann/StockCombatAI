	description = A recent development in combat survivability, this intelligent, life-saving device has seen survival rates increase tenfold thanks to its revolutionary new ability to jettison crew in the event of the catastrophic loss of the ship, and automatically ferry them to safety. It's got people thinking, "why didn't we come up with this before?"\n\nDISCLAIMER: The HKA® KCS-3™ Escape Pod Controller should be installed <b>on</b> the relevant escape pod. The HKA® branded KCS Designation™ module on the relevant decoupler should be set to "Escape Pod". KCS Designation™ modules are included as standard on all good coupling brands.
